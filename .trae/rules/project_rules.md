Always devide a big task into mini todo list using sequential Thinking
When asked to use shadcn ui always refer to shacn-ui mcp 
First get the list of componenets availaible to get the idea of shadcn ui components
First try the the component using get_component_demo tool of shadcn ui 
Than if possible use get_component tool to implement it!
or if you want to use whole block you can use get_block tool!
After each task use Playwright mcp to take screen shot ! and see if the desired result is done or not
Iterate the process using sequential Thinking MCP until desired results are achieved
